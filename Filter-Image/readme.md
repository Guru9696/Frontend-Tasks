A simple project demonstrating the use of HTML and CSS to create interactive image filters. This project utilizes CSS filter properties to apply various effects to images without relying on JavaScript.

## Features

- Interactive slider to adjust filter values
- Lightweight and simple design

## Demo

You can try the image filter demo by opening the \`index.html\` file in your browser.

    \`\`\`

## Project Structure

├── index.html        # The main HTML file containing the image and filter controls

## Usage

### Image Filters

The project uses the CSS \`filter\` property to apply different effects to the image. Some of the available filters are:

- \`grayscale()\`
- \`sepia()\`
- \`blur()\`
- \`brightness()\`
- \`contrast()\`
- \`saturate()\`

You can combine multiple filters to create custom effects.

### Slider Controls

The filter values can be adjusted in real-time using the slider controls provided below the image. These sliders modify the CSS properties dynamically:

- **Brightness**: Adjust the brightness of the image.
- **Grayscale**: Convert the image to grayscale.
- **Blur**: Apply a blur effect to the image.
- **Contrast**: Increase or decrease the contrast of the image.
- **Saturation**: Modify the saturation level of the image.

## How to Customize

To add new filters or change existing ones:

1. Modify the \`style.css\` file
