# Sliding Tab in HTML

This project implements a sliding tab navigation feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to switch between different content sections by clicking on tabs. The active tab smoothly slides to indicate the selected section.

## Features

- Sliding effect when switching between tabs.
- Lightweight and simple to implement.
- Customizable design for easy integration into any project.

## Prerequisites

To use the Sliding Tab feature, you need:

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A web browser for testing the implementation.

## Files Included

- \`index.html\`: Contains the HTML structure for the sliding tabs.
- \`styles.css\`: Contains the styling for the tabs and the sliding effect.
- \`scripts.js\`: JavaScript to handle the sliding tab functionality.



## How It Works

1. The \`.tabs\` section consists of clickable div elements styled as tabs.
2. When a tab is clicked, JavaScript updates the \`active\` class:
   - The clicked tab gets highlighted.
   - The corresponding content section becomes visible.
3. The sliding effect is achieved through CSS transitions and transforms.

## Customization

- **Tab Color**: You can change the background color for the \`.tab.active\` class to customize the active tab style.
- **Transition Effect**: Adjust the \`transition\` property in CSS to customize the sliding effect speed.
- **Content Sections**: You can add more tabs and corresponding content sections by duplicating the HTML blocks and updating the IDs accordingly.
